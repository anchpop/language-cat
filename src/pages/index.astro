      <div class="intro">
        <p>
          I'm building a free language-learning app. But I noticed I spent as
          much time gathering and structuring data as I did actually developing
          the app. So I'm releasing the data I gathered, to help others also
          interested in building a language-learning app. Welcome to
          <i>languagecat</i>!
        </p>
        <p>
          languagecat provides a curated dataset with everything you need to get
          started building your own language-learning app.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a public resource created as part of the <a
            href="https://yap.town"

      <div class="what-section">
        <h2>What do I need to make a language-learning app?</h2>
        <p>
          You need a dictionary and you need sentences. The dictionary is
          essential so users can look up words. The sentences are essential so
          you can have users practice translating. (I know there are other
          philosophies of language-learning apps which might not require this
          exact setup. But they can make their own datasets. 😸)
        </p>

        <div class="subsections-grid">
          <div class="subsection">
            <h3>The Dictionary</h3>
            <p>
              Not any dictionary will do. You need a dictionary focused on
              language-learners, which is different from a traditional
              dictionary. Traditional dictionaries are <a
                href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%A0#French"
                >exhaustive</a
              > in their definitions and information, to the point of being mostly
              useless for beginners to the language. Language-learners need just the
              most essential information.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="subsection">
            <h3>The Sentences</h3>
            <p>
              Language-learners need a gradient of sentences from simple to
              hard. The most important step in learning a language is getting a
              lot of input that's suitable for the learner's skill level. So the
              app needs sentences that match all skill levels.
            </p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="whats-in-section">
        <h2>What's in languagecat?</h2>
        <p>
          languagecat is structured as "language packs" from language A to
          language B. (For example, there is a French-for-English-Speakers pack
          that contains French words with their definitions in English.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Each language pack contains tens of thousands of words and hundreds of
          thousands of sentences.
        </p>

        <h3>Dictionary</h3>

        <div class="dictionary-example">
          <div class="example-label">
            French-to-English dictionary entry example:
          </div>
          <div class="entry-word">
            <span class="word">a</span>
            <span class="lemma">avoir</span>
            <span class="pos">VERB</span>
          </div>
          <div class="entry-definition">
            <strong>has</strong>
          </div>
          <div class="entry-example">
            <em>Elle a deux chats.</em> — She has two cats.
          </div>
          <div class="entry-morphology">
            Singular, Present, Third person, Indicative
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>For each word, I provide:</p>
        <div class="features-grid">
          <div class="feature-item">Frequency</div>
          <div class="feature-item">Definitions</div>
          <div class="feature-item">Example sentences</div>
          <div class="feature-item">Pronunciation (IPA)</div>
          <div class="feature-item">Part of speech</div>
          <div class="feature-item">Morphology</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Since words can have multiple parts of speech, frequency data is
          tracked separately for each usage. This means that my frequency
          analysis was much more sophisticated than just checking for text in my
          corpus. I ran a custom neural-network-based NLP pipeline on the entire
          corpus, but more on that later.
        </p>

        <h3>Phrasebook</h3>

        <p>
          In addition to individual words, I include multi-word terms and
          phrases. These are useful because they often have their own meaning
          that needs to be learned independently from their component words.
        </p>

        <div class="dictionary-example">
          <div class="example-label">
            French-to-English phrasebook entry example:
          </div>
          <div class="entry-word">
            <span class="word">être sur son 31</span>
          </div>
          <div class="entry-definition">
            <strong
              >to be dressed very smartly; to be dressed to the nines</strong
            >
          </div>
          <div class="entry-example">
            <em>Pour le mariage, tout le monde était sur son 31.</em> — For the wedding,
            everyone was dressed to the nines.
          </div>
          <div class="entry-morphology">
            Used when someone is wearing their best, most elegant clothes for a
            special occasion.
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Sentences</h3>

        <p>
          Each sentence in the dataset is fully analyzed with detailed
          linguistic information for every word, making it easy to build
          interactive learning experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          This breakdown is extremely useful for building language-learning apps
          because it allows you to programmatically understand what's happening
          in a sentence. For example, "bois" in French can be either a verb
          ("drink") or a noun ("wood"). The two usages have completely different
          meanings. Looking at just the text, they're indistinguishable, but
          with this linguistic breakdown, your software can easily tell the
          difference.

      </div>

      <div class="nlp-section">
        <h2>Custom NLP Models</h2>
        <p>
          To create the sophisticated linguistic analysis in languagecat, I
          custom trained my own suite of NLP models. These models are what
          enable the word-by-word breakdown, part-of-speech tagging, and
          frequency analysis that's separated by word usage.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of my models are <a
            href="https://huggingface.co/collections/anchpop/lexide-nlp-models"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">available on Hugging Face</a
          >
          for anyone to use.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="movie-section">
        <h2>Movie Data</h2>
        <p>
          Sentences come from two main sources: <a
            href="https://tatoeba.org"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">Tatoeba</a
          >
          and movies from <a
            href="https://www.opensubtitles.org"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">Open Subtitles</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          For sentences sourced from movies, I include the localized movie names
          and posters for the language being learned. For example, "Fight Club"
          becomes "El Club de la Lucha" in the Spanish dataset, complete with
          the Spanish movie poster:
        </p>
        <div class="movie-poster-example">
          <img
            src="/src/assets/El-Club-de-la-Lucha.jpg"
            alt="El Club de la Lucha movie poster"
          />
          <div class="poster-caption">El Club de la Lucha (Fight Club)</div>
        </div>
        <p>
          I also provide separate frequency lists for each movie in the dataset.
          This allows you to show your users how close they are to being able to
          watch a particular movie—a great motivational feature for language
          learners.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="format-section">
        <h2>Format</h2>
        <p>
          The data is provided in JSON, which is straightforward to parse in any
          programming language. Each part of each pack (e.g., the list of
          sentences, the translations) has its own JSON file, so you can only
          download what you need.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, JSON is incredibly slow to parse when you're dealing with
          tens of thousands of words and hundreds of thousands of sentences. For
          this reason, I also provide the data in a custom format using a fork
          of rkyv (a Rust library that allows extremely fast deserialization).
          This is the same format used internally by yap.town. Please contact me
          if you'd like to use this format; it's a little bit involved in order
          to be as efficient as possible. It will not be possible to use this
          format outside of a Rust program.

        <p>
          Creating each language pack takes quite a bit of time and money. In
          total, I've spent about $3000 on this project so far. To be clear,
          most of this data wasn't generated manually—it came from a combination
          of external sources (Tatoeba and Open Subtitles), LLMs, and a small
          amount of manual labeling.
